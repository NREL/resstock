# Multifamily Project Folder

This folder contains the ResStock inputs to model the residential building stock of the national building stock comprised of both single family and multifamily buildings. The main inputs that characterize the building stock is the housing characteristics in the `housing_characteristics/` directory. Information about these characteristics can be found in the `resources/housing characteristics info.json` file. This file provides information about all of the housing characteristics and their dependencies and options used in this project of ResStock. And is used to create the dependency wheels, Sankey diagram, and the detailed housing characteristic information all found later in this file.

## Visualization of the Housing Characteristic Dependencies

ResStock is built upon the conditional probabilites of the housing characteristics.  Each housing characteristic has a set of dependencies and dependants.  An interactive dependency and dependents visualization is provided in the links below:

## Modifying this project `README.md` file

This README file is generated by the `util/projectReadmeFile/createProjectReadmeFile.ipynb` file.  The notebook uses `util/projectReadmeFile/base_README.md` as the start of the file, and then concatenates information about the housing characteristic found in the `util/housing characteristics info.json` file.  If modifications are needed to this file, modify the `housing characteristics info.json` file or the `util/projectReadmeFile/base_README.md` file.  Then, execute the `util/projectReadmeFile/createProjectReadmeFile.ipynb` notebook which will incorporate the modifications into this file.

# Detailed Housing Characteristic Information

The information above helps elude to the structure and relationships between the housing characteristics and thier data sources.  A more detailed explaination of each housing characteristic is provided below.

## Area Mean Income
<u>Description:</u> The housing characteristic "Area Mean Income" (AMI) is midpoint of the region's income distribution. In this case the reported area is every census tract, location EPW weather file, and county. Within each census tract the AMI is also reported for different housing vintages, housing size, heating fuel, and cooling type. The AMI distribution is distributed between different owner and renter age ranges.

This report describes the underlying methods and data for estimating energy consumption. Using engineering models, the site estimates energy consumption for six major categories (end uses); heating, cooling, water heating, major appliances, lighting, and miscellaneous equipment. The approach taken by the Home Energy Saver is to provide users with initial results based on a minimum of user input, allowing progressively greater control in specifying the characteristics of the house and energy consuming appliances. Outputs include energy consumption (by fuel and end use), energy-related emissions (carbon dioxide), energy bills (total and by fuel and end use), and energy saving recommendations. Real-world electricity tariffs are used for many locations, making the bill estimates even more accurate. Where information about the house is not available from the user, default values are used based on end-use surveys and engineering studies. An extensive body of qualitative decision-support information augments the analytical results. ii},

A full distribution system developed in TRNSYS has been validated using field monitoring data and then exercised in a number of climates to understand climate impact on performance. This study builds upon previous analysis modelling work to evaluate differing distribution systems and the sensitivities of water heating energy and water use efficiency to variations of climate, load, distribution type, insulation and compact plumbing practices. Overall 124 different TRNSYS models were simulated. Of the configurations evaluated, distribution losses account for 13-29{\%} of the total water heating energy use and water use efficiency ranges from 11-22{\%}. The base case, an uninsulated trunk and branch system sees the most improvement in energy consumption by insulating and locating the water heater central to all fixtures. Demand recirculation systems are not projected to provide significant energy savings and in some cases increase energy consumption. Water use is most efficient with demand recirculation systems, followed by the insulated trunk and branch system with a central water heater. Compact plumbing practices and insulation have the most impact on energy consumption (2-6{\%} for insulation and 3-4{\%} per 10 gallons of enclosed volume reduced). The results of this work are useful in informing future development of water heating best practices guides as well as more accurate (and simulation time efficient) distribution models for annual whole house simulation programs.},

A full distribution system developed in TRNSYS has been validated using field monitoring data and then exercised in a number of climates to understand climate impact on performance. This study builds upon previous analysis modelling work to evaluate differing distribution systems and the sensitivities of water heating energy and water use efficiency to variations of climate, load, distribution type, insulation and compact plumbing practices. Overall 124 different TRNSYS models were simulated. Of the configurations evaluated, distribution losses account for 13-29{\%} of the total water heating energy use and water use efficiency ranges from 11-22{\%}. The base case, an uninsulated trunk and branch system sees the most improvement in energy consumption by insulating and locating the water heater central to all fixtures. Demand recirculation systems are not projected to provide significant energy savings and in some cases increase energy consumption. Water use is most efficient with demand recirculation systems, followed by the insulated trunk and branch system with a central water heater. Compact plumbing practices and insulation have the most impact on energy consumption (2-6{\%} for insulation and 3-4{\%} per 10 gallons of enclosed volume reduced). The results of this work are useful in informing future development of water heating best practices guides as well as more accurate (and simulation time efficient) distribution models for annual whole house simulation programs.},

		@techreport{Weitzel2014, abstract = {A developing body of work is forming that collects data on domestic hot water consumption, water use behaviors, and energy efficiency of various distribution systems. A full distribution system developed in TRNSYS has been validated using field monitoring data and then exercised in a number of climates to understand climate impact on performance. This study builds upon previous analysis modelling work to evaluate differing distribution systems and the sensitivities of water heating energy and water use efficiency to variations of climate, load, distribution type, insulation and compact plumbing practices. Overall 124 different TRNSYS models were simulated. Of the configurations evaluated, distribution losses account for 13-29{\%} of the total water heating energy use and water use efficiency ranges from 11-22{\%}. The base case, an uninsulated trunk and branch system sees the most improvement in energy consumption by insulating and locating the water heater central to all fixtures. Demand recirculation systems are not projected to provide significant energy savings and in some cases increase energy consumption. Water use is most efficient with demand recirculation systems, followed by the insulated trunk and branch system with a central water heater. Compact plumbing practices and insulation have the most impact on energy consumption (2-6{\%} for insulation and 3-4{\%} per 10 gallons of enclosed volume reduced). The results of this work are useful in informing future development of water heating best practices guides as well as more accurate (and simulation time efficient) distribution models for annual whole house simulation programs.},

		@techreport{Chan2012, abstract = {LBNL Residential Diagnostics Database (ResDB) contains blower door measurements and other diagnostic test results of homes in United States. Of these, approximately 134,000 single-family detached homes have sufficient information for the analysis of air leakage in relation to a number of housing characteristics. We performed regression analysis to consider the correlation between normalized leakage and a number of explanatory variables: IECC climate zone, floor area, height, year built, foundation type, duct location, and other housing characteristics. The regression model explains 68{\%} of the observed variability in normalized leakage. ResDB also contains the before and after retrofit air leakage measurements of approximately 23,000 homes that participated in weatherization assistant programs (WAPs) or residential energy efficiency programs. The two types of programs achieve rather similar reductions in normalized leakage: 30{\%} for WAPs and 20{\%} for other energy programs.},

		@techreport{Wilson2014, abstract = {Building America's House Simulation Protocols report is designed to assist researchers in tracking the progress of multiyear, whole-building energy reduction against research goals for new and existing homes. These protocols are preloaded into BEopt and use a consistent approach for defining a reference building, so that all projects can be compared to each other. The steps involved in conducting performance analysis include: - Defining the appropriate reference building. Various climate regions, house sizes, and house ages require slightly different reference buildings; this report guides the user through to the most appropriate fit for the project. - Selecting energy upgrades. With an overwhelming number of options and technologies on the market, it can be difficult to narrow down the best choices for reaching savings goals. BEopt software can easily be used to determine the most cost-effective solutions for each project. - Determining the energy savings. After a project has been completed, the measures selected can be compared to the appropriate reference building using BEopt and the overall energy savings can be determined.},
