# Description: The heating fuel of the pool heater if there is a pool.
# Source: Constructed using U.S. EIA 2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) microdata.
# Source: Constructed using the California Energy Commision 2019 Residential Appliance Saturation Study (RASS) microdata.
# Assumption: Within electric pool heaters, proportion of heat pump electric pool heating vs. non-heat pump electric pool heating was derived from RASS 2019.
