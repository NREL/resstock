        Support constant electricity emissions factors

        Description:
        Add support for constant electricity emissions factors through the ``elec_value`` emissions scenario field.
        Values are specified in kg/MWh, including zero, and each scenario must specify exactly one of ``elec_folder``
        or ``elec_value``. Update the residential workflow generator to version ``2026.10.05``.

        Title:
        Add baseline_validation tool to resstockpostproc

        Description:
        Adds a baseline validation tool that compares a ResStock baseline run against public data sources
        (EIA 861, EIA 176, RECS 2020, LRD) and generates an interactive comparison dashboard. Supports annual and
        monthly resolutions across U.S. Total, state, census division, building type, vintage, climate zone, and
        heating-fuel aggregations. A baseline-validation CI job runs the tool under --test on every PR and
        uploads the generated dashboard as a CI artifact for review.

        Title:
        Move BuildResidentialHPXML measure to option-based arguments

        Description:
        Refactors ResStock to use the new BuildResidentialHPXML measure, which now has ~100 options instead of ~600 detailed
        properties as arguments. Also moves much of the ResStock special sauce around configuring the HPXML models into the
        ResStockArgumentsPostHPXML measure. The options_lookup.tsv file is now significantly simpler.

        Clean up baseline HVAC options

        Description:
        Continuing from PR 1503, cleaned up baseline HVAC options by switching to use SEER2 for CAC and SEER2/HSPF2 for ASHP.
        Some HVAC option efficiencies were modified to better align with OS-HPXML default relationships.
