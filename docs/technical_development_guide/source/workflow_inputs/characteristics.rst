- \% Area Median Income is calculated using annual household income in 2019USD (continuous, not binned) from 2019-5yrs PUMS data and 2019 Income Limits from HUD. These limits adjust for household size AND local housing costs (AKA Fair Market Rents). Income Limits reported at county subdivisions are consolidated to County using a crosswalk generated from Missouri Census Data Center's geocorr (2014), which has 2010 ACS housing unit count. For the 478 counties available in PUMS (60%), the county-level Income Limits are used. For all others (40%), PUMA-level Income Limits are used, which are converted from county-level using the spatial_tract_lookup file containing 2010 ACS housing unit count.

- \Dwelling unit sub-tsv : deps=['Geometry Building Type RECS', 'State', 'Heating Fuel', 'Vintage'] with the following fallback coarsening order

  - \[1] State coarsened to Census Division RECS with AK/HI separate

  - \[2] Heating Fuel coarsened to Other Fuel, Wood and Propane combined

  - \[3] Heating Fuel coarsened to Fuel Oil, Other Fuel, Wood and Propane combined

  - \[4] Geometry Building Type RECS coarsened to SF/MF/MH

  - \[5] Geometry Building Type RECS coarsened to SF and MH/MF

  - \[6] Vintage coarsened to every 20 years before 2000 and every 10 years subsequently

  - \[7] Vintage homes built before 1960 coarsened to pre1960

  - \[8] Vintage homes built after 2000 coarsened to 2000-20

  - \[9] Census Division RECS with AK/HI separate coarsened to Census Division RECS

  - \[10] Census Division RECS to Census Region

  - \[11] Census Region to National

- \Household sub-tsv : deps=['Geometry Building Type RECS', 'State' 'Tenure', 'Federal Poverty Level'] with the following fallback coarsening order

  - \[1] State coarsened to Census Division RECS with AK/HI separate

  - \[2] Geometry Building Type RECS coarsened to SF/MF/MH

  - \[3] Geometry Building Type RECS coarsened to SF and MH/MF

  - \[4] Federal Poverty Level coarsened every 100 percent

  - \[5] Federal Poverty Level coarsened every 200 percent

  - \[6] Census Division RECS with AK/HI separate coarsened to Census Division RECS

  - \[7] Census Division RECS to Census Region

  - \[8] Census Region to National

- \In combining the dwelling unit sub-tsv and household sub-tsv, the conditional relationships are ignored across (['Heating Fuel', 'Vintage'], ['Tenure', 'Federal Poverty Level']).

- \For dependency conditions with low samples, the following lumpings are used in progressive order until there are enough samples: 1) lumping buildings into Single-Family and Multi-Family only, 2) lumping buildings into Single-Family and Multi-Family only and lumping nearby climate zones within A/B regions and separately 7AK and 8AK 3) lumping all building types together and lumping climate zones within A/B regions and separately 7AK and 8AK, 4) Owner and Renter are is lumped together which at this point only modifies AK distributions.Vacant units (for which Tenure = 'Not Available') are assumed to follow the same distribution as occupied  units

- \Cooling setpoint arguments need to be assigned. A cooling setpoint of None corresponds to 95 F, but is not used by OpenStudio-HPXML. No cooling energy is expected.

- \Because we need to assume a foundation type for ground-floor MF units, we use the lumped SFD+SFA distributions for MF2-4 and MF5+ building foundations. (RECS data for households in MF2-4 unit buildings are not useful since we do not know which floor the unitis on. RECS does not include foundation responses for households in MF5+ unit buildings.)

Assumption
**********

- \Only Single-Family Detached homes are assigned a probability for attached garage.

- \No garage for ambient (i.e., pier & beam) foundation type.

- \Due to modeling constraints restricting that garage cannot be larger or deeper than livable space: Single-family detached units that are 0-1499 square feet can only have a maximum of a 1 car garage.

- \Single-family detached units that are 0-1499 square feet and 3+ stories cannot have a garage.

- \The geometry stories distributions are all the same except for 0-1499 square feet and 3 stories.

- \Single-family detached units that are 1500-2499 square feet can not have a 3 car garage.

- \Single-family detached units that are 2500-3999 square feet and a heated basement can not have a 3 car garage. Due to low sample sizes, 1. Crawl, basements, and slab are lumped.

- \2. Story levels are lumped together.

- \2. Census Division RECS is grouped into Census Region.

- \2. Vintage ACS is progressively grouped into: pre-1960, 1960-1999, and 2000+.

- \All mobile homes are 1 story.

- \Single-Family Detached and Single-Family Attached use the STORIES field in RECS, whereas Multifamily with 5+ units uses the NUMFLRS field.

- \Building types 2 Unit and 3 or 4 Unit use the stories distribution of Multifamily 5 to 9 Unit (capped at 4 stories) because RECS does not report stories or floors for multifamily with 2-4 units.

- \The dependency on floor area bins is removed for multifamily with 5+ units.

- \Vintage ACS rows for the 2010s are copied from the 2000-09 rows.

Assumption
**********

- \Check the assumptions on the source tsv files.

- \If a house has a wall furnace with fuel other than natural_gas, efficiency level based on natural_gas from expanded_HESC_HVAC_efficiencies.tsv is assigned.

- \If a house has a heat pump with fuel other than electricity (presumed dual-fuel heat pump), the heating type is assumed to be furnace and not heat pump.

- \The shipment volume for boiler was not available, so shipment volume for furnace in furnace-shipments-table.tsv was used instead.

- \Due to low sample size for some categories, the HVAC Has Shared System categories 'Cooling Only' and 'None' are combined for the purpose of querying Heating Efficiency distributions.

- \For 'other' heating system types, we assign them to Electric Baseboard if fuel is Electric, and assign them to Wall/Floor Furnace if fuel is natural_gas, fuel_oil or propane.

- \For Other Fuel and Wood, the lowest efficiency systems are assumed.

- \For Alaska, we are using a field in ARIS that lumps multi-family 2-4 units and multi-family 5+ units buildings together. Data from the American Community Survey is used to distribute the between these two building types.

- \For Alaska, electric space heaters are modeled as electric baseboards.

- \For Alaska, Toyo/monitor direct-vent devices and other fuel space heaters are not modeled.

- \For Alaska, fireplace and stoves are not modeled.

- \For Alaska, all heat pumps (including geothermal) are assumed to be non-ducted air source heat pumps.

- \For Alaska, when heating uses more than one fuels, the fuel with highest consumption is considered the primary (heating) fuel, and fuel with second highest usage (provided it is at least 10% of total energy use across all fuels) is considered secondary (heating) fuel - except in case of electric heating, which is always assumed as primary (i.e., secondary heating fuel cannot be electricity). Rest of the fuels are ignored.

- \A unit without a primary heating system (heating fuel is None) cannot have a secondary heating system (secondary heating fuel is None).

- \Alaska specific distribution is based on Alaska Retrofit Information System (2008 to 2022) maintained by Alaska Housing Finance Corporation.


Assumption
**********

- \In ACS, Heating Fuel is reported for occupied units only. By excluding Vacancy Status as a dependency, we assume vacant units share the same Heating Fuel distribution as occupied units. Where sample counts are less than 10, the State average distribution has been inserted. Prior to insertion, the following adjustments have been made to the state distribution so all rows have sample count > 10: 1. Where sample counts < 10 (which consists of Mobile Home and Single-Family Attached only), the Vintage ACS distribution is used instead of Vintage: [CT, DE, ID, MD, ME, MT, ND, NE, NH, NV, RI, SD, UT, VT, WY]

- \2. Remaining Mobile Homes < 10 are replaced by Single-Family Detached + Mobile Homes combined: [DE, RI, SD, VT, WY, and all DC].

- \For Alaska, we are using a field in ARIS that lumps multi-family 2-4 units and multi-family 5+ units buildings together. Data from the American Community Survey is used to distribute the between these two building types.

- \For Alaska, all wood is modeled as cord wood.

- \For Alaska, when heating uses more than one fuels, the fuel with highest consumption is considered the primary (heating) fuel, and fuel with second highest usage (provided it is at least 10% of total energy use across all fuels) is considered secondary (heating) fuel - except in case of electric heating, which is always assumed as primary. Rest of the fuels are ignored.

- \Distributions are based on the cumulative distribution functions from the Residential Diagnostics Database (ResDB), http://resdb.lbl.gov/.

- \Alaska specific distribution is based on Alaska Retrofit Information System (2008 to 2022) maintained by Alaska Housing Finance Corporation.


Assumption
**********

- \All ACH50 are based on Single-Family Detached blower door tests.

- \Climate zones that are copied: 2A to 1A, 6A to 7A, and 6B to 7B.

- \Vintage bins that are copied: 2000s to 2010s, 1950s to 1940s, 1950s to <1940s.

- \Homes are assumed to not be Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) qualified and not ENERGY STAR certified.

- \Climate zones 7AK and 8AK are averages of 6A and 6B.

- \ResStock models multi-family and SFA units with the unit total air leakage type. The unit total air leakage assume that some of the sampled ACH50 value goes to neighboring units. The model infiltration value to the exterior is a smaller infiltration value that what is sampled and is adjusted by the ratio of exterior envelope surface area to total envelope surface area. The modeled infiltration to the exterior is reported in the results.

- \For Alaska, we are using a field in ARIS that lumps multi-family 2-4 units and multi-family 5+ units buildings together. Data from the American Community Survey is used to distribute the between these two building types.

- \For Alaska, Infiltration ACH50 values are calculated based on CFM50 from blower door test and estimated volume of the home.

Misc Extra Refrigerator
-----------------------

Description
***********

The presence and rated efficiency of the secondary refrigerator.

Created by
**********

``sources/recs/recs2020/tsv_maker.py``

Source
******

- \U.S. EIA 2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) microdata.

- \Age of refrigerator converted to efficiency levels using ENERGYSTAR shipment-weighted efficiencies by year data from Home Energy Score: http://hes-documentation.lbl.gov/. Check the comments in: HES-Refrigerator_Age_vs_Efficiency.tsv


Assumption
**********

- \The current year is assumed to be 2022

- \Previously, for each year, the EF values were rounded to the nearest EF level, and then the distribution of EF levels were calculated for the age bins. Currently, each year has its own distribution and then we average out the distributions to get the distribution for the age bins. EF for all years are weighted equally when calculating the average distribution for the age bins.

- \EnergyStar distributions from 2009 dependent on [Geometry Building Type RECS,Federal Poverty Level,Tenure] is used to calculate efficiency distribution in RECS2020.EnergyStar Refrigerators assumed to be 10% more efficient than standard.Due to low sample count, the tsv is constructed by downscaling a dwelling unit sub-tsv with a household sub-tsv. The sub-tsvs have the following dependencies:

- \Dwelling unit sub-tsv : deps=['Geometry Building Type RECS', 'State', 'Vintage'] with the following fallback coarsening order

  - \[1] State coarsened to Census Division RECS with AK/HI separate

  - \[2] Geometry Building Type RECS coarsened to SF/MF/MH

  - \[3] Geometry Building Type RECS coarsened to SF and MH/MF

  - \[4] Vintage with Vintage ACS

  - \[5] Vintage with combined 1960s

  - \[6] Vintage with combined 1960s and post 200ss

  - \[7] Census Division RECS with AK/HI separate coarsened to Census Division RECS

  - \[8] Census Division RECS to Census Region

  - \[9] Census Region to National

- \Household sub-tsv : deps=['Geometry Building Type RECS', 'State' 'Tenure', 'Federal Poverty Level'] with the following fallback coarsening order

  - \[1] State coarsened to Census Division RECS with AK/HI separate

  - \[2] Geometry Building Type RECS coarsened to SF/MF/MH

  - \[3] Geometry Building Type RECS coarsened to SF and MH/MF

  - \[4] Federal Poverty Level coarsened every 100 percent

  - \[5] Federal Poverty Level coarsened every 200 percent

  - \[6] Census Division RECS with AK/HI separate coarsened to Census Division RECS

  - \[7] Census Division RECS to Census Region

  - \[8] Census Region to National

- \In combining the dwelling unit sub-tsv and household sub-tsv, the conditional relationships are ignored across ('Heating Fuel', ['Tenure', 'Federal Poverty Level']).

Assumption
**********

- \'PUMA Metro Status', derived from ACS IPUMS METRO codes, indicates whether the household resided within a metropolitan area and, for households in metropolitan areas, whether the household resided within or outside of a central/principal city. Each PUMA has a unique METRO status in ACS and therefore has a unique PUMA Metro Status. IPUMS derives METRO codes for samples not directly identified based on available geographic information and whether the associated county group or PUMA lies wholly or only partially within metropolitan areas or principal cities.

- \Age of refrigerator converted to efficiency levels using ENERGYSTAR shipment-weighted efficiencies by year data from Home Energy Score: http://hes-documentation.lbl.gov/. Check the comments in: HES-Refrigerator_Age_vs_Efficiency.tsv


Assumption
**********

- \The current year is assumed to be 2022 (previously, it was 2016)

- \Previously, for each year, the EF values were rounded to the nearest EF level, and then the distribution of EF levels were calculated for the age bins. Currently, each year has its own distribution and then we average out the distributions to get the distribution for the age bins. EF for all years are weighted equally when calculating the average distribution for the age bins.

- \EnergyStar distributions from 2009 dependent on [Geometry Building Type RECS,Federal Poverty Level,Tenure] is used to calculate efficiency distribution in RECS2020.EnergyStar Refrigerators assumed to be 10% more efficient than standard.Due to low sampling count, the following coarsening rules are incorporated[1] State coarsened to Census Division RECS with AK/HI separate

  - \[2] Geometry Building Type RECS coarsened to SF/MF/MH

  - \[3] Geometry Building Type RECS coarsened to SF and MH/MF

State Metro Median Income
-------------------------

Description
***********

State Metro median income of the household occupying the dwelling unit.             This is different from State Median Income in that the Income Limits are differentiated by Metro and             Nonmetro portions of the state.

Created by
**********

``sources/pums/pums2019_5yrs/tsv_maker.py``

Source
******

- \% State Metro Median Income is calculated using annual household income in 2019USD (continuous, not binned) from 2019-5yrs PUMS data and 2019 state median income (SMI) by metro/nonmetro area from HUD. A County Metro Status-differentiated Income Limits table is derived from the SMI by adjusting for household size only, which is consistent with how HUD's published State Income Limits table is generated.

- \Penetration of HPWH for Maine (6.71%) calculated based on total number of HPWH units (AWHI Stakeholder Meeting 12/08/2022) and total housing units https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/ME


Assumption
**********

- \Water heater blanket is used as a proxy for premium storage tank water heaters.

- \Heat Pump Water Heaters are added in manually as they are not in the survey.

- \Default solar thermal collector assumed: 40 sqft, Roof Pitch,

- \Solar thermal backup is informed by secondary water heater fuel type. Solar collector orientation is based on rooftop solar orientation for electric backup and assumed south-facing for fuel backup. If a solar thermal system has no secondary water heater or has a second solar thermal system, they are assumed to have electric backup.

- \Other Fuel water heater energy is modeled as coal

- \Due to low sample sizes, fallback rules applied with lumping of:

  - \[1] State: Census Division RECS

  - \[2] State: Census Region[3] State: National

- \U.S. EIA 2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) microdata.

- \Alaska specific distribution is based on Alaska Retrofit Information System (2008 to 2022) maintained by Alaska Housing Finance Corporation.


Assumption
**********

- \After conversations with EIA, other fuel is a combination of units with no-water heater, biomass, coal, or district steam systems.

- \Due to low sample sizes, fallback rules applied with lumping of:

  - \[1] Geometry building SF: Mobile, Single family attached, Single family detached

  - \[2] Geometry building MF: Multi-Family with 2 - 4 Units, Multi-Family with 5+ Units

  - \[3] State: Census Division RECS

  - \[4] State: Census Region

  - \[5] State: National

- \For Alaska, we are using a field in ARIS that lumps multi-family 2-4 units and multi-family 5+ units buildings together. Data from the American Community Survey is used to distribute the between these two building types.

- \For Alaska, wood and coal heating is modeled as other fuel.

- \For Alaska, when a building uses more than one fuel for water heating, the fuel with highest consumption is considered the water heater fuel. Rest of the fuels are ignored.

- \H2OMAIN = other is equally distributed amongst attic and crawlspace.

- \H2OMAIN does not apply to multi-family, therefore Water heater location for multi-family with in-unit water heater is taken after the combined distribution of other building types.

- \out-of-unit water heater is assumed to be in Conditioned Mechanical Room. Per expert judgement, water heaters can not be outside or in vented spaces for IECC Climate Zones 4-8 due to pipe-freezing risk.

- \Where samples < 10, data is aggregated in the following order:

- \1. Building Type lumped into single-family, multi-family, and mobile home.

Assumption
**********

- \Wood and Vinyl are considered same material

- \Triple Pane assumed to be 100% low-e

- \Only breaking out clear and low-e windows for the Double, Non-Metal frame type

- \Source of low-e distribution is based on engineering judgement, informed by high-levelsales trends observed in Ducker Worldwide studies of the U.S. Market for Windows, Doors and Skylights.

- \Due to low sample sizes, the following adjustments are made:

  - \[1] Vintage data are grouped into: 1) <1960, 2) 1960-79, 3) 1980-99, 4) 2000s, 5) 2010s.

  - \[2] Building Type data are grouped into: 1) Single-Family Detached, Single-Family Attached, and Mobile homes and 2) Multi-Family 2-4 units and Multi-Family 5+ units.

  - \[3] Climate zones are grouped into: 1) 1A, 2A, 2B

- \2) 3A, 3B, 3C, 4B

- \3) 4A, 4C

- \4) 5A, 5B

- \5) 6A, 6B

- \and 6) 7A, 7B 7AK, 8AK.

  - \[4] Federal Poverty Levels are progressively grouped together until all bins are combined.

  - \[5] Tenure options are progressively grouped together until all bins are combined.

- \Storm window saturations are based on D&R International, Ltd. 'Residential Windows and Window Coverings: A Detailed View of the Installed Base and User Behavior' 2013. https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/11/f5/residential_windows_coverings.pdf. Cut the % storm windows by factor of 55% because only 55% of storms are installed year round

- \Due to lack of performance data storm windows with triple-pane are modeled without the storm windows

- \Due to lack of performance data Double-pane, Low-E, Non-Metal, Air, M-gain, Exterior Clear Storm windows are modeled as Double-pane, Clear, Non-Metal, Air, Exterior Clear Storm windows
