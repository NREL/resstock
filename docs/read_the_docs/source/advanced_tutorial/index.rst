Advanced Tutorial
=================

This advanced tutorial describes the process for developing residential measures and testing residential building models. Reasons for wanting to develop residential measures include: customizing any of the existing residential modeling algorithms or adding new technology models.

At this point in the tutorial, it is assumed that you have checked out a new branch that is up-to-date with the ``develop`` of the `ResStock <https://github.com/NREL/resstock>`_ repository. Optionally, you may have created a new project folder (i.e., copied an existing project folder) and modified the set of tsv files in its ``housing_characteristics`` folder.

If your changes are intended to be merged into the ``develop`` branch of the `ResStock <https://github.com/NREL/resstock>`_ repository, a pull request review is required.
