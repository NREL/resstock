Installation
============

Download ResStock
-----------------

There are two options for downloading `ResStock <https://github.com/NREL/resstock>`_:

1. download a released version
2. clone the repository

For the first option, go to the `releases page <https://github.com/NREL/resstock/releases>`_ on GitHub and select a release. Note the OpenStudio version requirements associated with each version of ResStock. For example, ResStock v2.4.0 requires that you have OpenStudio v2.9.0 installed.

For the second option, you will need to have `Git <https://git-scm.com>`_ or some other Git-based tool installed. Cloning the ResStock repository gives you access to the ``develop`` branch of ResStock. The ``develop`` branch is under active development.

Install OpenStudio
------------------

Download the version of OpenStudio software (corresponding to the ResStock version that has been selected) from the `OpenStudio developer website <https://www.openstudio.net/developers>`_.

Developer instructions
----------------------

If you will be developing residential measures and testing residential building models, see the :ref:`advanced_tutorial`. If you are a developer, make sure that you have checked out the ``develop`` branch of the repository.
