Workflow Inputs
===============

OpenStudio-HPXML requires a building description in an `HPXML file <https://hpxml.nrel.gov/>`_ format.
HPXML is an open data standard for collecting and transferring home energy data. 
Using HPXML files reduces the complexity and effort for software developers to leverage the EnergyPlus simulation engine.

Using HPXML
-----------

HPXML is an flexible and extensible format, where nearly all elements in the schema are optional and custom elements can be included.
Because of this, a stricter set of requirements for the HPXML file have been developed for purposes of running EnergyPlus simulations.

HPXML files submitted to OpenStudio-HPXML undergo a two step validation process:

1. Validation against the HPXML Schema

  The HPXML XSD Schema can be found at ``HPXMLtoOpenStudio/resources/hpxml_schema/HPXML.xsd``.
  XSD Schemas are used to validate what elements/attributes/enumerations are available, data types for elements/attributes, the number/order of children elements, etc.

2. Validation using `Schematron <http://schematron.com/>`_

  The Schematron document for the EnergyPlus use case can be found at ``HPXMLtoOpenStudio/resources/hpxml_schematron/EPvalidator.xml``.
  Schematron is a rule-based validation language, expressed in XML using XPath expressions, for validating the presence or absence of inputs in XML files. 
  As opposed to an XSD Schema, a Schematron document validates constraints and requirements based on conditionals and other logical statements.
  For example, if an element is specified with a particular value, the applicable enumerations of another element may change.

OpenStudio-HPXML **automatically validates** the HPXML file against both the XSD and Schematron documents and reports any validation errors, but software developers may find it beneficial to also integrate validation into their software.

Input Defaults
**************

A large number of elements in the HPXML file are optional and can be defaulted.
Default values, equations, and logic are described throughout this documentation.

For example, suppose a HPXML file has a refrigerator defined as follows:

.. code-block:: XML

  <Refrigerator>
    <SystemIdentifier id='Refrigerator1'/>
  </Refrigerator>

Default values would be used for the refrigerator energy use, location, and schedule:

.. code-block:: XML

  <Refrigerator>
    <SystemIdentifier id='Refrigerator1'/>
    <Location dataSource='software'>conditioned space</Location>
    <RatedAnnualkWh dataSource='software'>691.0</RatedAnnualkWh>
    <PrimaryIndicator dataSource='software'>true</PrimaryIndicator>
    <extension>
      <UsageMultiplier dataSource='software'>1.0</UsageMultiplier>
      <WeekdayScheduleFractions dataSource='software'>0.040, 0.039, 0.038, 0.037, 0.036, 0.036, 0.038, 0.040, 0.041, 0.041, 0.040, 0.040, 0.042, 0.042, 0.042, 0.041, 0.044, 0.048, 0.050, 0.048, 0.047, 0.046, 0.044, 0.041</WeekdayScheduleFractions>
      <WeekendScheduleFractions dataSource='software'>0.040, 0.039, 0.038, 0.037, 0.036, 0.036, 0.038, 0.040, 0.041, 0.041, 0.040, 0.040, 0.042, 0.042, 0.042, 0.041, 0.044, 0.048, 0.050, 0.048, 0.047, 0.046, 0.044, 0.041</WeekendScheduleFractions>
      <MonthlyScheduleMultipliers dataSource='software'>0.837, 0.835, 1.084, 1.084, 1.084, 1.096, 1.096, 1.096, 1.096, 0.931, 0.925, 0.837</MonthlyScheduleMultipliers>
    </extension>
  </Refrigerator>

These defaults will be reflected in the EnergyPlus simulation results.

.. note::

  The OpenStudio-HPXML workflow generally treats missing *elements* differently than missing *values*.
  For example, if there is no ``Refrigerator`` element defined, the simulation will proceed without refrigerator energy use.
  On the other hand, if there is a ``Refrigerator`` element but with no values defined (i.e., no ``Location`` or ``RatedAnnualkWh``), it is assumed that a refrigerator exists but its properties are unknown, so they will be defaulted in the model.

See :ref:`hpxml_defaults` for information on how default values can be inspected.

  .. [#] The default value of 7 is an average value found in the literature when calibrating timeseries EnergyPlus indoor temperatures to field data.
  .. [#] TemperatureCapacitanceMultiplier affects the transient calculation of indoor air temperatures.
         Values greater than 1.0 have the effect of smoothing or damping the rate of change in the indoor air temperature from timestep to timestep.
         This heat capacitance effect is modeled on top of any other individual mass inputs (e.g., furniture mass, partition wall mass, interior drywall, etc.) in the HPXML.
  .. [#] DefrostModelType choices are "standard" and "advanced".
  .. [#] Use "standard" for default E+ defrost setting.
         Use "advanced" for an improved model that better accounts for load and energy use during defrost; using "advanced" may impact simulation runtime.
  .. [#] OnOffThermostatDeadbandTemperature is currently only allowed with a 1 minute timestep.
         Currently only supports homes with at most one cooling system (including heat pumps) serving 100% of the cooling load and at most one heating system (including heat pumps) serving 100% of the heating load (i.e., FractionHeatLoadServed and FractionCoolLoadServed are 1.0).
         Applies to single speed and two speed AC/ASHP only.
  .. [#] An on/off thermostat deadband temperature is applied to both heating and cooling.
         Typical values are between 2-4 F, with actual values being specific to the thermostat installed.
         Note that thermostat deadbands are two sided.
         As an example, if you had a heating setpoint of 71 F and a 2 F deadband, the heating equipment will turn on when the space temperature hits 70 F and off when it hits 72 F.
         When this feature is enabled, the model will also explicitly model cycling, such that it will take several minutes for the HVAC to reach full capacity for single and two speed AC/ASHP systems, and time-based realistic staging (stay at low speed for 5 minutes before transitioning to the higher stage, and stay at high speed until cut-out deadband temperature is reached) for two speed AC/ASHP systems.
         This feature should only be used if detailed power profiles and loads are required.
         Common use cases for this feature are when modeling advanced controls, such as a Home Energy Management System, or if performing co-simulation with a grid model. 
  .. [#] HeatPumpBackupCapacityIncrement is currently only allowed with a 1 minute timestep.

  .. [#] AnnualExcessSellbackRateType choices are "User-Specified" and "Retail Electricity Cost".
  .. [#] When annual PV production exceeds the annual building electricity consumption, this rate, which is often significantly below the retail rate, determines the value of the excess electricity sold back to the utility.
         This may happen to offset gas consumption, for example.
  .. [#] AnnualExcessSellbackRate is only used when AnnualExcessSellbackRateType="User-Specified".
  .. [#] Since modeled electricity consumption will not change from one year to the next, "indefinite rollover" of annual excess generation credit is best approximated by setting "User-Specified" and entering a rate of zero.

  .. [#] FeedInTariffRate applies to full (not excess) PV production.
         Some utilities/regions may have a feed-in tariff policy where compensation occurs for excess PV production (i.e., PV-generated electricity sent to the grid that is not immediately consumed by the building), rather than full PV production.
         OpenStudio-HPXML is currently unable to calculate utility bills for such a feed-in tariff policy.

HPXML Building
--------------

OpenStudio-HPXML can be used to model either individual residential :ref:`bldg_type_dwelling_units` or :ref:`bldg_type_whole_mf_buildings`.

In either case, each residential dwelling unit is entered as a ``/HPXML/Building``.

.. _bldg_type_dwelling_units:

Dwelling Units
**************

OpenStudio-HPXML can model individual residential dwelling units -- either a single-family detached (SFD) building, or a single unit of a single-family attached (SFA) or multifamily (MF) building.
This approach:

- Is required/desired for certain applications (e.g., a Home Energy Score or an Energy Rating Index calculation).
- Improves runtime speed by being able to simulate individual units in parallel (as opposed to simulating the entire building).

For these simulations:

- Surfaces can be defined adjacent to generic SFA/MF spaces (e.g., "other housing unit" or "other multifamily buffer space") with assumed temperature profiles (see :ref:`hpxml_locations`).
- Various building components (e.g., ducts, water heaters, appliances) can be located in these SFA/MF spaces.
- Shared systems (HVAC, water heating, mechanical ventilation, etc.) serving multiple dwelling units can be defined, in which these systems are approximated as individual systems with efficiency adjustments to estimate the energy use attributed to the unit.
- Energy use attributed only to the dwelling unit is calculated.

.. _bldg_type_whole_mf_buildings:

Whole SFA/MF Buildings
**********************

Alternatively, OpenStudio-HPXML can model whole SFA/MF buildings in a single combined simulation.

Modeling a whole SFA/MF building is defined in ``/HPXML/SoftwareInfo/extension``.

  ==================================  ========  =====  ===========  ========  ========  ========================================================

  .. [#] When WholeSFAorMFBuildingSimulation is false and the HPXML contains multiple ``Building`` elements, you must tell OpenStudio-HPXML which ``Building`` to run as described in the :ref:`basic_run` usage instructions.

For these simulations:

- An HPXML file with multiple ``Building`` elements is used, where each ``Building`` represents an individual dwelling unit.
- Unit multipliers (using the ``NumberofUnits`` element; see :ref:`building_construction`) can be specified to model *unique* dwelling units, rather than *all* dwelling units, reducing simulation runtime.
- Adjacent SFA/MF common spaces are still modeled using assumed temperature profiles, not as separate thermal zones. (This may change in the future.)
- Shared systems are still modeled as individual systems, not shared systems connected to multiple dwelling unit. (This may change in the future.)
- Energy use for the entire building is calculated; you cannot get energy use for individual dwelling units. (This may change in the future.)

Notes/caveats about this approach:

- Some inputs (e.g., EPW location or ground conductivity) cannot vary across ``Building`` elements.
- :ref:`hpxml_batteries` are not currently supported.
- :ref:`hpxml_utility_bill_scenarios` using *detailed* :ref:`electricity_rates` are not supported.

HPXML Schedules
***************

Schedules for a variety of building features can be defined using:

- :ref:`schedules_simple`
- :ref:`schedules_detailed`
- :ref:`schedules_default`

It is allowed to use simple, detailed, and defaulted values in the same HPXML file.

.. _schedules_simple:

Simple Schedule Inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simple schedule inputs are available as weekday/weekend fractions and monthly multipliers for a variety of building characteristics.
For example, see the ``WeekdayScheduleFractions``, ``WeekendScheduleFractions``, and ``MonthlyScheduleMultipliers`` inputs for :ref:`building_occupancy`.

.. _schedules_detailed:

Detailed Schedule Inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Detailed schedule inputs allow schedule values for every hour or timestep of the simulation.
They can be used to reflect real-world or stochastic occupancy.

Detailed schedule inputs are provided via one or more CSV file that should be referenced in the HPXML file as ``/HPXML/Building/BuildingDetails/BuildingSummary/extension/SchedulesFilePath`` elements.
The column names available in the schedule CSV files are:

  ================================  =======  =================================================================================  ===============================

  .. [#] A detailed stochastic occupancy schedule CSV file can also be automatically generated for these columns; see the :ref:`usage_instructions` for the commands.
         The stochastic occupancy schedules are generated using the methodology described in `Stochastic simulation of occupant-driven energy use in a bottom-up residential building stock model <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261922011540>`_.
         Inputs for the stochastic schedule generator are entered in:

         \- ``/HPXML/Building/BuildingDetails/BuildingSummary/BuildingOccupancy/NumberofResidents``

         \- ``/HPXML/Building/Site/Address/StateCode`` (optional)

         \- ``/HPXML/Building/Site/GeoLocation/Latitude`` (optional)

         \- ``/HPXML/Building/Site/GeoLocation/Longitude`` (optional)

         \- ``/HPXML/Building/Site/TimeZone/UTCOffset`` (optional)

         See :ref:`building_occupancy` and :ref:`building_site` for more information.

  .. [#] This feature is an advanced research capability. This schedule allows modeling shedding controls for variable speed HVAC systems (instead of setpoint changes) to limit the power of HVAC per `AHRI 1380 <https://www.ahrinet.org/search-standards/ahri-1380-i-p-demand-response-through-variable-capacity-hvac-systems-residential-and-small>`_. 
         While any fraction value can be entered, this is primarily intended to reflect the AHRI capabilities, which has two levels of load shed: "General Curtailment" and "Critical Curtailment". 
         A "General Curtailment" signal prevents the equipment from running at more than 70% of max power and "Critical Curtailment" limits it to 40% of max power until comfort constraints are violated (4F off the setpoint).
         During the shedding events, the main heat pump is limited to running below the specified fraction of rated power, and the backup system is locked out.
         When the comfort constraints are violated, both heat pump and backup systems are allowed to run at full load to recover the indoor temperature until reaching setpoint.

Columns with units of `frac` must be normalized to MAX=1; that is, these schedules only define *when* energy is used, not *how much* energy is used.
In other words, the amount of energy or hot water used in each simulation timestep is essentially the schedule value divided by the sum of all schedule values in the column, multiplied by the annual energy or hot water use.
Example schedule CSV files are provided in the ``HPXMLtoOpenStudio/resources/schedule_files`` directory.

The schedule file must have a full year of data even if the simulation is not an entire year.
Frequency of schedule values do not need to match the simulation timestep.
For example, hourly schedules can be used with a 10-minute simulation timestep, or 10-minute schedules can be used with an hourly simulation timestep.

.. warning::

  For simulations with daylight saving enabled (which is the default), EnergyPlus will skip forward an hour in the CSV on the "spring forward" day and repeat an hour on the "fall back" day.

.. _schedules_default:

Default Schedules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If neither simple nor detailed inputs are provided, then schedules are defaulted.
Default schedules are typically smooth, averaged schedules.
These default schedules (and data sources) are described in the table below (e.g., see "occupants" rows for the default occupant heat gain schedule).
They can also be found at ``HPXMLtoOpenStudio/resources/data/default_schedules.csv``.

  .. [#] HeatPumpSizingMethodology choices are 'ACCA', 'HERS', or 'MaxLoad', and are described as follows:
  
         \- **ACCA**: autosized heat pumps have their nominal capacity sized per ACCA Manual J/S based on cooling design loads, with some oversizing allowances for larger heating design loads.
         
         \- **HERS**: same as **ACCA** except autosized heat pumps have their nominal capacity sized equal to at least the larger of heating and sensible cooling design loads.
         
         \- **MaxLoad**: autosized heat pumps have their nominal capacity sized based on the larger of heating/cooling design loads, while taking into account the heat pump's reduced capacity at the design temperature, such that no backup heating should be necessary.

  .. [#] HeatPumpBackupSizingMethodology choices are 'emergency' or 'supplemental', and are described as follows:

         \- **emergency**: heat pump backup capacity will be autosized to meet the ACCA Manual J heating design load.
         
         \- **supplemental**: heat pump backup capacity will be autosized to meet the remainder of the ACCA Manual J heating design load not met by the heat pump at the heating design temperature.

         Heat pump backup capacity is often sized for emergency heat so that it can meet the entire design load if the heat pump fails.
         Some contractors/homeowners may choose not to do so, perhaps due to insufficient panel/wiring capacity.
         Note: If the minimum temperature for the heat pump's compressor (i.e., ``CompressorLockoutTemperature`` or ``BackupHeatingSwitchoverTemperature``) is above the heating design temperature, the two sizing methodologies will give identical results.
  .. [#] If AllowIncreasedFixedCapacities is true, the larger of user-specified fixed capacity and design load will be used (to reduce potential for unmet loads); otherwise user-specified fixed capacity is used.

  The specification of conditioned zones does not currently affect the energy simulation as all conditioned space in a dwelling unit is currently modeled as a single EnergyPlus conditioned thermal zone.
  If multiple conditioned zones are specified, the HVAC systems attached to a given zone are assumed to fully condition it for the HVAC design load calculations.

.. _enclosure:

HPXML Enclosure
---------------

The dwelling unit's enclosure is entered in ``/HPXML/Building/BuildingDetails/Enclosure``.

All surfaces that bound different space types of the dwelling unit (i.e., not just thermal boundary surfaces) must be specified in the HPXML file.
For example, an attached garage would generally be defined by walls adjacent to conditioned space, walls adjacent to outdoors, a slab, and a roof or ceiling.
For software tools that do not collect sufficient inputs for every required surface, the software developers will need to make assumptions about these surfaces or collect additional input.

Interior partition surfaces (e.g., walls between rooms inside conditioned space, or the floor between two conditioned stories) can be excluded.

For single-family attached (SFA) or multifamily (MF) buildings, surfaces between unconditioned space and the neighboring unit's same unconditioned space should set ``InteriorAdjacentTo`` and ``ExteriorAdjacentTo`` to the same value.
For example, a foundation wall between the unit's vented crawlspace and the neighboring unit's vented crawlspace would use ``InteriorAdjacentTo="crawlspace - vented"`` and ``ExteriorAdjacentTo="crawlspace - vented"``.

.. warning::

  It is the software tool's responsibility to provide the appropriate building surfaces. 
  While some error-checking is in place, it is not possible to know whether some surfaces are incorrectly missing.

Also note that wall and roof surfaces do not require an azimuth/orientation to be specified. 
Rather, only the windows/skylights themselves require an azimuth/orientation. 
Thus, software tools can choose to use a single wall (or roof) surface to represent multiple wall (or roof) surfaces for the entire building if all their other properties (construction type, interior/exterior adjacency, etc.) are identical.

  .. [#] TypeOfInfiltrationLeakage choices are "unit total" or "unit exterior only", and are described as follows:
  
         \- **unit total**: the provided infiltration value represents the total infiltration to the dwelling unit, as measured by a compartmentalization test, in which case it will be adjusted by ``extension/Aext``.
         
         \- **unit exterior only**: the provided infiltration value represents the infiltration to the dwelling unit from outside only, as measured by a guarded test.

  .. [#] TypeOfInfiltrationLeakage required if single-family attached or apartment unit.
  .. [#] InfiltrationVolume can be thought of as the volume of space most impacted by a blower door test.
         Note that InfiltrationVolume can be larger than ConditionedBuildingVolume as it can include, e.g., attics or basements with access doors/hatches that are open during the blower door test.
  .. [#] If InfiltrationHeight not provided, it is inferred from other inputs (e.g., conditioned floor area, number of conditioned floors above-grade, above-grade foundation wall height, etc.).
  .. [#] InfiltrationHeight is defined as the vertical distance between the lowest and highest above-grade points within the pressure boundary, per ASHRAE 62.2.
         It is used along with the ``UnitHeightAboveGrade`` in :ref:`bldg_constr` to calculate the wind speed for the infiltration model.
  .. [#] If Aext not provided and TypeOfInfiltrationLeakage is "unit total", defaults for single-family attached and apartment units to the ratio of exterior (adjacent to outside) envelope surface area to total (adjacent to outside, other dwelling units, or other MF spaces) envelope surface area, as defined by `ANSI/RESNET/ICC 301-2019 <https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/RESNET3012019P1>`_ and `ASHRAE 62.2-2019 <https://www.techstreet.com/ashrae/standards/ashrae-62-2-2019?product_id=2087691>`_.
         Note that all attached surfaces, even adiabatic surfaces, must be defined in the HPXML file.
         If single-family detached or TypeOfInfiltrationLeakage is "unit exterior only", Aext is 1.

In addition, one of the following air leakage types must also be defined:

- :ref:`infil_ach_cfm`
- :ref:`infil_natural_ach_cfm`
- :ref:`infil_ela`
- :ref:`infil_leakiness_description`

.. note::

  Infiltration airflow rates are calculated using the `Alberta Air Infiltration Model (AIM-2) <https://www.aivc.org/sites/default/files/airbase_3705.pdf>`_ (also known as the ASHRAE Enhanced model).
  When there is a flue or chimney present (see :ref:`flueorchimney`) with combustion air from conditioned space, higher infiltration airflow rates are modeled because the flue leakage is at a different height for stack effect.

  .. [#] LeakinessDescription choices are "very tight", "tight", "average", "leaky" or "very leaky".
  .. [#] For energy modeling, average air leakage is estimated via a regression developed by LBNL using ResDB data (https://resdb.lbl.gov) that takes into account IECC climate zone, conditioned floor area, year built, foundation type, duct location, etc.
         The leakiness description is then used to further adjust the default (average) infiltration rate using leakage multipliers derived from ACCA Manual J Table 5A.

  .. note::

    Provide ``BackupHeatingSwitchoverTemperature`` for a situation where there is a discrete outdoor temperature below which the heat pump stops operating and above which the backup heating system stops operating.
    Note that this control strategy has risk of the heating setpoint not being maintained (i.e., unmet hours) when the outdoor temperature is just above the switchover temperature, as the heat pump may not have sufficient capacity to meet the heating load and the backup is disabled.

    Alternatively, provide A) ``CompressorLockoutTemperature`` to specify the outdoor temperature below which the heat pump stops operating and/or B) ``BackupHeatingLockoutTemperature`` to specify the outdoor temperature above which the heat pump backup system stops operating.
    If both are provided, the compressor and backup system can both operate between the two temperatures (e.g., simultaneous operation or cycling).
    If both are provided using the same temperature, it is equivalent to using ``BackupHeatingSwitchoverTemperature``.

  .. [#] It is recommended to provide DuctInsulationRValue and not DuctEffectiveRValue.
         DuctInsulationRValue represents the nominal insulation R-value and should not include interior/exterior air films (i.e., use 0 for an uninsulated duct).
         For ducts buried in insulation (i.e., DuctBuriedInsulationLevel is any value but "not buried"), DuctInsulationRValue should only represent any surrounding insulation duct wrap and not the entire attic insulation R-value.
         DuctEffectiveRValue is used in the actual duct heat transfer calculation, and should include all effects (i.e., interior/exterior air films, adjustments for presence of round ducts, and adjustments when buried in loose-fill attic insulation).
         When DuctEffectiveRValue is not provided, it is calculated from DuctInsulationRValue, DuctFractionRectangular, and DuctBuriedInsulationLevel based on ANSI/RESNET/ICC 301-2025 (not yet published) assuming round supply ducts are 6-in on average and round return ducts are 14-in on average.
  .. [#] DuctBuriedInsulationLevel choices are "not buried", "partially buried", "fully buried", or "deeply buried".
  .. [#] Whether the ducts are buried in, e.g., attic loose-fill insulation.
         Partially buried ducts have insulation that does not cover the top of the ducts.
         Fully buried ducts have insulation that just covers the top of the ducts.
         Deeply buried ducts have insulation that continues above the top of the ducts.
         See the `Building America Solution Center <https://basc.pnnl.gov/resource-guides/ducts-buried-attic-insulation>`_ for more information.
  .. [#] DuctLocation choices are "conditioned space", "basement - conditioned", "basement - unconditioned", "crawlspace - unvented", "crawlspace - vented", "crawlspace - conditioned", "attic - unvented", "attic - vented", "garage", "outside", "exterior wall", "under slab", "roof deck", "other housing unit", "other heated space", "other multifamily buffer space", "other non-freezing space", or "manufactured home belly".
         See :ref:`hpxml_locations` for descriptions.
  .. [#] If DuctLocation not provided, defaults to the first present space type: "basement - conditioned", "basement - unconditioned", "crawlspace - conditioned", "crawlspace - vented", "crawlspace - unvented", "attic - vented", "attic - unvented", "garage", or "conditioned space".
         If NumberofConditionedFloorsAboveGrade > 1, secondary ducts will be located in "conditioned space".
  .. [#] The sum of all ``FractionDuctArea`` must each equal to 1, both for the supply side and return side.
  .. [#] FractionDuctArea or DuctSurfaceArea are required if DuctLocation is provided.
         If both are provided, DuctSurfaceArea will be used in the model.
  .. [#] If neither DuctSurfaceArea nor FractionDuctArea provided, duct surface areas will be calculated based on `ASHRAE Standard 152 <https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/downloads/ashrae-standard-152-spreadsheet>`_:
         
         \- **Primary supply duct area**: 0.27 * F_out * ConditionedFloorAreaServed

         \- **Secondary return duct area**: b_r * (1 - F_out) * ConditionedFloorAreaServed
         
         where F_out is 1.0 when NumberofConditionedFloorsAboveGrade <= 1 and 0.75 when NumberofConditionedFloorsAboveGrade > 1, and b_r is 0.05 * NumberofReturnRegisters with a maximum value of 0.25.
         
         If FractionDuctArea is provided, each duct surface area will be FractionDuctArea times total duct area, which is calculated using the sum of primary and secondary duct areas from the equations above.

  .. [#] DuctShape choices are "rectangular", "round", "oval", or "other".
  .. [#] If DuctFractionRectangular not provided, defaults to 1.0 if DuctShape is "rectangular" and 0.0 if DuctShape is "round" or "oval".

  .. [#] If SupplementalFanRunsWithAirHandlerFan is true, in addition to its normal operation, the supplemental fan will also run simultaneously with the air handler fan when outdoor air is being brought in.

         NCfl = number of conditioned floor levels in the residence including conditioned basements,
         
         Bsmnt = presence (1.0) or absence (0.0) of an unconditioned basement in the residence. If a building has both a conditioned and unconditioned basement on the same level, Bsmnt = 0 to avoid double counting.
         
  .. [#] PipingLength is the length of hot water piping from the shared recirculation loop to the farthest hot water fixture, measured longitudinally from plans, assuming the hot water piping does not run diagonally, plus 10 feet of piping for each floor level, plus 5 feet of piping for unconditioned basements (if any).
  .. [#] Additional drain water heat recovery inputs are described in :ref:`water_heater_dwhr`.

         \- **presence sensor demand control**: The pump only runs when a sensor detects someone is present at the faucet.
         
         \- **temperature**: The pump runs based on monitoring temperature at some point in the system.
         
         \- **timer**: The pump is controlled by a timer.

.. note::

  The shared recirculation system is required to have a standard in-unit hot water distribution system;
  stacked recirculation systems (i.e., shared recirculation loop plus an additional in-unit recirculation system) are more likely to indicate input errors than reflect an actual real-world scenario.

 .. note::

  An unscheduled battery in a home with photovoltaics (PV) will be controlled using a simple control strategy designed to maximize on site consumption of energy.
  The battery will charge if PV production is greater than the building electrical load and the battery is below its maximum capacity, while the battery will discharge if the building electrical load is greater than PV production and the battery is above its minimum capacity.

  A battery can alternatively be controlled using :ref:`schedules_detailed`, where charging and discharging schedules are defined.
  Positive schedule values control timing and magnitude of charging storage.
  Negative schedule values control timing and magnitude of discharging storage.
  Simultaneous charging and discharging of the battery is not allowed.
  The round trip efficiency affects charging and discharging; the reported charging and discharging rates will be larger than the schedule value by an amount equal to the losses due to the round trip efficiency.

  A battery in a home without PV or charging/discharging schedules is assumed to operate as backup and is not modeled.

  Dehumidifiers are currently modeled as located within conditioned space; the model is not suited for a dehumidifier in, e.g., a wet basement or crawlspace where there is significant moisture from the ground.
  Therefore the dehumidifier Location is currently restricted to "conditioned space".
  Like an HVAC system, the dehumidifier operates as needed to maintain the RH setpoint for the conditioned space.

HPXML Misc Loads

Miscellaneous loads are entered in ``/HPXML/Building/BuildingDetails/MiscLoads``.

.. _plug_loads:

HPXML Plug Loads
****************

Each type of plug load can be entered as a ``/HPXML/Building/BuildingDetails/MiscLoads/PlugLoad``.

It is required to include miscellaneous plug loads (PlugLoadType="other"), which represents all residual plug loads not explicitly captured elsewhere.
It is common to include television plug loads (PlugLoadType="TV other"), which represents all television energy use in the home.
It is less common to include the other plug load types, as they are less frequently found in homes.
If not entered, the simulation will not include that type of plug load.

  .. [#] OpenStudio-HPXML does not model "conditioned" or "heated" garages.
         Many conditioned garages are not conditioned 24/7, rather they are only conditioned for short periods when occupants are in them and turn on the space conditioning equipment, so it is best to assume an unconditioned garage.
         However, if a garage was converted into livable space, then "conditioned space" should be used instead.

.. note::

  All conditioned space in a dwelling unit (i.e., "conditioned space", "basement - conditioned", and "crawlspace - conditioned") is modeled as a single thermal zone, in which a single air temperature/humidity is calculated for each timestep.

Validating & Debugging Errors
-----------------------------

When running HPXML files, errors may occur because:

#. An HPXML file provided is invalid (either relative to the HPXML schema or the EnergyPlus Use Case).
#. An unexpected EnergyPlus simulation error occurred.

If an error occurs, first look in the run.log for details.
If there are no errors in that log file, then the error may be in the EnergyPlus simulation -- see eplusout.err.

Contact us if you can't figure out the cause of an error.

Sample Files
------------

Dozens of sample HPXML files are included in the workflow/sample_files directory.
The sample files help to illustrate how different building components are described in HPXML.

Each sample file generally makes one isolated change relative to the base HPXML (base.xml) building.
For example, the base-dhw-dwhr.xml file adds a ``DrainWaterHeatRecovery`` element to the building.

You may find it useful to search through the files for certain HPXML elements or compare (diff) a sample file to the base.xml file.
