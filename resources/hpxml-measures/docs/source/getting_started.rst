Getting Started
===============

Setup
-----

To get started:

#. Download `OpenStudio 3.0.0 <https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/releases/tag/v3.0.0>`_ and install the Command Line Interface/EnergyPlus components, or use the `nrel/openstudio docker image <https://hub.docker.com/r/nrel/openstudio>`_.
#. Download the `latest release <https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-HPXML/releases>`_ for these OpenStudio measures.

Running
-------

To programatically run simulations, it's recommended to use the OpenStudio `Command Line Interface <http://nrel.github.io/OpenStudio-user-documentation/reference/command_line_interface/>`_.
Two general approaches (basic and advanced) for running via the CLI are described below.
The OpenStudio measures can also be run from user interfaces (e.g., the `OpenStudio Application <http://nrel.github.io/OpenStudio-user-documentation/reference/openstudio_application_interface/>`_ or `Parametric Analysis Tool <http://nrel.github.io/OpenStudio-user-documentation/reference/parametric_analysis_tool_2/>`_).

.. note:: 

  If the ``openstudio`` command is not found, it's because the executable is not in your PATH. Either add the executable to your PATH or point directly to the executable found in the openstudio-X.X.X/bin directory.

Basic Run
~~~~~~~~~

The simplest and fastest method is to call the OpenStudio CLI with the provided ``workflow/run_simulation.rb`` script.

For example:
``openstudio workflow/run_simulation.rb -x workflow/sample_files/base.xml``

This will create a "run" directory with all input/output files.
By default it will be found at the same location as the input HPXML file.

Run ``openstudio workflow/run_simulation.rb -h`` to see all available commands/arguments.

Advanced Run
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
If additional flexibility is desired (e.g., specifying individual measure arguments, including additional OpenStudio measures to run alongside this measure in a workflow, etc.), create an `OpenStudio Workflow (OSW) <https://nrel.github.io/OpenStudio-user-documentation/reference/command_line_interface/#osw-structure>`_ file.
The OSW is a JSON file that will specify all the OpenStudio measures (and their arguments) to be run sequentially.
A template OSW that simply runs the HPXMLtoOpenStudio and SimulationOutputReport measures on the ``workflow/sample_files/base.xml`` file can be found at ``workflow/template.osw``.

For example:
``openstudio run -w workflow/template.osw``

This will create a "run" directory with all input/output files.
By default it will be found at the same location as the OSW file.

Outputs
~~~~~~~

In addition to the standard EnergyPlus outputs found in the run directory, a variety of high-level annual outputs are conveniently reported in the resulting ``run/results_annual.csv`` file.

Timeseries outputs can also be requested using either the Basic or Advanced approaches.
When requested, timeseries outputs will be found in the ``run/results_timeseries.csv`` file.

See the :ref:`simreport` section for a description of all available outputs available.
