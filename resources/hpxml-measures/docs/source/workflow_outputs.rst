Annual Outputs
--------------

OpenStudio-HPXML will always generate an annual output file called results_annual.csv (or results_annual.json), co-located with the EnergyPlus output.
The file includes the following sections of output:

Annual Energy Consumption by Fuel Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fuel uses are listed below.

   ====================================  ===========================

   ====================================  ===========================

Annual Energy Consumption By End Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

End uses are listed below.

Note that all end uses are mutually exclusive -- the "Electricity: Heating" end use, for example, excludes energy reported in the "Electricity: Heating Fans/Pumps" end use.
So the sum of all end uses for a given fuel (e.g., sum of all "End Use: Natural Gas: \*") equal the above reported fuel use (e.g., "Fuel Use: Natural Gas: Total").

Annual Building Loads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Annual building loads are listed below.

   =====================================  ==================================================================
   Type                                   Notes
   =====================================  ==================================================================
   Load: Heating: Delivered (MBtu)        Includes HVAC distribution losses.
   Load: Cooling: Delivered (MBtu)        Includes HVAC distribution losses.
   Load: Hot Water: Delivered (MBtu)      Includes contributions by desuperheaters or solar thermal systems.
   Load: Hot Water: Tank Losses (MBtu)
   Load: Hot Water: Desuperheater (MBtu)  Load served by the desuperheater.
   Load: Hot Water: Solar Thermal (MBtu)  Load served by the solar thermal system.
   =====================================  ==================================================================

Note that the "Delivered" loads represent the energy delivered by the HVAC/DHW system; if a system is significantly undersized, there will be unmet load not reflected by these values.

Annual Unmet Hours
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Annual unmet hours are listed below.

   =========================  =====
   Type                       Notes
   =========================  =====
   Unmet Hours: Heating (hr)  Number of hours where the heating setpoint is not maintained.
   Unmet Hours: Cooling (hr)  Number of hours where the cooling setpoint is not maintained.
   =========================  =====

These numbers reflect the number of hours of the year when the conditioned space temperature is more than 0.2 deg-C (0.36 deg-F) from the setpoint during heating/cooling.

Peak Building Electricity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Peak building electricity outputs are listed below.

   ==================================  =========================================================
   Type                                Notes
   ==================================  =========================================================
   Peak Electricity: Winter Total (W)  Winter season defined by operation of the heating system.
   Peak Electricity: Summer Total (W)  Summer season defined by operation of the cooling system.
   ==================================  =========================================================

Peak Building Loads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Peak building loads are listed below.

   ====================================  ==================================
   Type                                  Notes
   ====================================  ==================================
   Peak Load: Heating: Delivered (kBtu)  Includes HVAC distribution losses.
   Peak Load: Cooling: Delivered (kBtu)  Includes HVAC distribution losses.
   ====================================  ==================================

Note that the "Delivered" peak loads represent the energy delivered by the HVAC system; if a system is significantly undersized, there will be unmet peak load not reflected by these values.

Annual Component Building Loads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Note**: This section is only available if the ``--add-component-loads`` argument is used.
The argument is not used by default for faster performance.

Component loads represent the estimated contribution of different building components to the annual heating/cooling building loads.
The sum of component loads for heating (or cooling) will roughly equal the annual heating (or cooling) building load reported above.

Component loads disaggregated by Heating/Cooling are listed below.

Timeseries Outputs
------------------

OpenStudio-HPXML can optionally generate a timeseries output file.
The timeseries output file is called results_timeseries.csv (or results_timeseries.json) and co-located with the EnergyPlus output.

Depending on the outputs requested, the file may include:

   ===================================  ==================================================================================================================================
   Type                                 Notes
   ===================================  ==================================================================================================================================
   Fuel Consumptions                    Energy use for each fuel type (in kBtu for fossil fuels and kWh for electricity).
   End Use Consumptions                 Energy use for each end use type (in kBtu for fossil fuels and kWh for electricity).
   Hot Water Uses                       Water use for each end use type (in gallons).
   Total Loads                          Heating, cooling, and hot water loads (in kBtu) for the building.
   Component Loads                      Heating and cooling loads (in kBtu) disaggregated by component (e.g., Walls, Windows, Infiltration, Ducts, etc.).
   Unmet Loads                          Unmet heating and cooling loads (in kBtu) for the building.
   Zone Temperatures                    Average temperatures (in deg-F) for each space modeled (e.g., living space, attic, garage, basement, crawlspace, etc.).
   Airflows                             Airflow rates (in cfm) for infiltration, mechanical ventilation (including clothes dryer exhaust), natural ventilation, whole house fans.
   Weather                              Weather file data including outdoor temperatures, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar.
   ===================================  ==================================================================================================================================

Timeseries outputs can be one of the following frequencies: hourly, daily, monthly, or timestep (i.e., equal to the simulation timestep, which defaults to an hour but can be sub-hourly).

Timestamps in the output use the end-of-hour (or end-of-day for daily frequency, etc.) convention.
Most outputs will be summed over the hour (e.g., energy) but some will be averaged over the hour (e.g., temperatures, airflows).

.. _hpxml_outputs:

HPXML Outputs
-------------

OpenStudio-HPXML will always generate an output file called results_hpxml.csv (or results_hpxml.json), co-located with the EnergyPlus output.
Unlike the other output files that are based on EnergyPlus simulation results, this file contains outputs summarizing the HPXML file (including defaults like auto-sized HVAC systems).
The file includes the following sections of output:
