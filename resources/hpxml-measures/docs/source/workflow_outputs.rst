.. _hpxml_defaults:

HPXML Defaults
--------------

OpenStudio-HPXML will always generate an HPXML file called ``in.xml``, located in the run directory.
This file reflects the HPXML input file provided by the user but includes any default values that OpenStudio-HPXML has used.
These default values will all be tagged with the ``dataSource='software'`` attribute.

For example, suppose a central air conditioner is described in the HPXML input file like so:

.. code-block:: XML

  <HVACPlant>
    <CoolingSystem>
      <SystemIdentifier id='CoolingSystem1'/>
      <DistributionSystem idref='HVACDistribution1'/>
      <CoolingSystemType>central air conditioner</CoolingSystemType>
      <CoolingSystemFuel>electricity</CoolingSystemFuel>
      <FractionCoolLoadServed>1.0</FractionCoolLoadServed>
      <AnnualCoolingEfficiency>
        <Units>SEER</Units>
        <Value>13.0</Value>
      </AnnualCoolingEfficiency>
    </CoolingSystem>
  </HVACPlant>

The ``in.xml`` output file will include autosized HVAC capacities as well as some other details:

.. code-block:: XML
 
  <HVACPlant>
    <CoolingSystem>
      <SystemIdentifier id='CoolingSystem1'/>
      <DistributionSystem idref='HVACDistribution1'/>
      <CoolingSystemType>central air conditioner</CoolingSystemType>
      <CoolingSystemFuel>electricity</CoolingSystemFuel>

Annual Energy By End Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

End uses are listed below.

Note that all end uses are mutually exclusive -- the "Electricity: Heating" end use, for example, excludes energy reported in the "Electricity: Heating Fans/Pumps" end use.
So the sum of all end uses for a given fuel (e.g., sum of all "End Use: Natural Gas: \*") equal the above reported fuel use (e.g., "Fuel Use: Natural Gas: Total").

Annual Building Loads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Annual building loads are listed below.

  ======================================  ==================================================================
  Type                                    Notes
  ======================================  ==================================================================
  Load: Heating: Delivered (MBtu)         Total heating load delivered, including distribution losses.
  Load: Heating: Heat Pump Backup (MBtu)  Heating load delivered by the heat pump backup only, including distribution losses.
  Load: Cooling: Delivered (MBtu)         Total cooling load delivered, including distribution losses.
  Load: Hot Water: Delivered (MBtu)       Total hot water load delivered, including contributions by desuperheaters or solar thermal systems.
  Load: Hot Water: Tank Losses (MBtu)
  Load: Hot Water: Desuperheater (MBtu)   Hot water load delivered by the desuperheater.
  Load: Hot Water: Solar Thermal (MBtu)   Hot water load delivered by the solar thermal system.
  ======================================  ==================================================================

Note that the "Delivered" loads represent the energy delivered by the HVAC/DHW system; if a system is significantly undersized, there will be unmet load not reflected by these values.
If the home is not fully conditioned (e.g., a room air conditioner that only meets 30% of the cooling load), the reported load will be likewise reduced compared to a home that is fully conditioned.

Annual Unmet Hours
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Annual unmet hours are listed below.

  =========================  =====
  Type                       Notes
  =========================  =====
  Unmet Hours: Heating (hr)  Number of hours where the heating setpoint is not maintained.
  Unmet Hours: Cooling (hr)  Number of hours where the cooling setpoint is not maintained.
  =========================  =====

These numbers reflect the number of hours during the heating/cooling season when the conditioned space temperature deviates more than 0.2 deg-C (0.36 deg-F) from the heating/cooling setpoint.

Peak Building Electricity

  Type                                     Notes
  =======================================  ==================================
  Peak Load: Heating: Delivered (kBtu/hr)  Includes HVAC distribution losses.
  Peak Load: Cooling: Delivered (kBtu/hr)  Includes HVAC distribution losses.
  =======================================  ==================================

Note that the "Delivered" peak loads represent the energy delivered by the HVAC system; if a system is significantly undersized, there will be unmet peak load not reflected by these values.
If the home is not fully conditioned (e.g., a room air conditioner that only meets 30% of the cooling load), the reported peak load will be likewise reduced compared to a home that is fully conditioned.

Annual Component Building Loads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Note**: This section is only available if the ``--add-component-loads`` argument is used.
The argument is not used by default for faster performance.

Component loads represent the estimated contribution of different building components to the annual heating/cooling building loads.
The sum of component loads for heating (or cooling) will roughly equal the annual heating (or cooling) building load reported above.

Component loads disaggregated by Heating/Cooling are listed below.
   
  =================================================  =========================================================================================================

  Component Load: \*: Whole House Fan (MBtu)         Heat gain/loss from airflow due to a whole house fan
  Component Load: \*: Ducts (MBtu)                   Heat gain/loss from conduction and leakage losses through supply/return ducts outside conditioned space
  Component Load: \*: Internal Gains (MBtu)          Heat gain/loss from appliances, plug loads, water heater tank losses, etc. in the conditioned space
  Component Load: \*: Lighting (MBtu)                Heat gain/loss from lighting in the conditioned space
  =================================================  =========================================================================================================

If the home is not fully conditioned (e.g., a room air conditioner that only meets 30% of the cooling load), the reported component loads will be likewise reduced compared to a home that is fully conditioned.

  ===================================  ====================

  .. [#] Calculation is performed every timestep and then averaged, which assumes a power outage is equally likely to occur every hour of the year.
         The entire electric load is treated as a "critical load" that would be supported during an outage.
         Resilience hours are set to 0 for any timestep where the battery is not charged, even if there is sufficient PV to power the building.

  ====================================================  ====================

.. note::

  Autosized HVAC systems are based on :ref:`hvac_design_temps` and :ref:`hvac_design_loads`.

  For heat pumps with a minimum compressor lockout temperature greater than the heating design temperature (e.g., a dual-fuel heat pump in a cold climate), the compressor will be sized based on heating design loads calculated at the compressor lockout temperature.
  This is done to prevent unutilized capacity at temperatures below the compressor lockout temperature.
  Any heat pump backup will still be based on heating design loads calculated using the heating design temperature.

  .. [#] This is the argument provided to ``run_simulation.rb`` as described in the :ref:`basic_run` usage instructions.

Timeseries outputs can be one of the following frequencies: hourly, daily, monthly, or timestep (i.e., equal to the simulation timestep, which defaults to an hour but can be sub-hourly).

Timestamps in the output use the start-of-period convention unless you have requested the end-of-period timestamp convention.
Additional timestamp columns can be optionally requested that reflect daylight saving time (DST) and/or coordinated universal time (UTC).
Most outputs will be summed over the hour (e.g., energy) but some will be averaged over the hour (e.g., temperatures, airflows).

Note that if the home is not fully conditioned (e.g., a room air conditioner that only meets 30% of the cooling load), the reported zone temperature for the conditioned space will reflect a fully conditioned home due to the way these systems are modeled in EnergyPlus.

Design Load Details Outputs
---------------------------

OpenStudio-HPXML provides an additional output file called ``results_design_load_details.csv`` (or ``.json`` or ``.msgpack``) that includes details related to the calculation of HVAC design loads for sizing equipment.
The file includes values pertaining to ACCA Form J1 (see example on page 2 of `here <https://www.acca.org/HigherLogic/System/DownloadDocumentFile.ashx?DocumentFileKey=4165a9b7-f229-421d-b20e-718cc83286df)>`_).

The file is organized into a few different reports described below.
