input data directory: requires results_up00 file
output data directory:data_/downsampled_buildings_id/euss1_2018_results_up00__downsampled_method1_{community}.csv
# Not available for hill_district as a small EUSS run is done separately with ~2k samples to add XPS for masonry walls.

2. get_community_results_from_euss.ipynb
Extract raw EUSS files for community informed by downsampled output.
Note: add_envelope_metrics.py (which can be run independently) is invoked in the notebook to add envelope ratings directly into the raw baseline file.

# Not needed for hill_district, however, run $ python add_envelope_metrics.py hill_district to add envelope ratings into raw baseline file.

2B. add_duct_conditioned_surface_area_and_cost.py <community>
Correct duct inconsistencies and costs in results. 
Add "hvac_has_ducts" and "duct_location" to baseline file.
Add "duct_conditioned_surface_area", "duct_unconditioned_surface_area", "duct_total_surface_area" to baseline and upgrade files. Use "duct_total_surface_area" for upgrade cost calc.
Override relevant "upgrade_costs.option_<>" columns and "upgrade_costs.upgrade_cost_usd" in upgrade files, remove buildings that no longer has an upgrade after duct fix.
